# DirectTrack
A Telegram bot created to track AMD GPUs and CPUs on the official website.
This is a very simple script that searches in selected pages if there's the Buy button (checks aviability), and if there is it'll report it.


# How to run
First check if you've installed all the dependecies required, then clone this repo and `python3 amdrxbot2`
