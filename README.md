# DirectTrack
A script created to track AMD GPUs and CPUs on the official website.
This is a very simple script that searches in selected pages if there's the Buy button (checks aviability), and if there is it'll report it.
In the future, I'm thinking to create a Telegram bot based on this script.

# How to run
First check if you've installed all the dependecies required, then clone this repo and `python3 amdrxbot2`
